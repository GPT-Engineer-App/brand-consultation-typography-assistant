Thank you for trusting me with your brand consultation needs. To provide a tailored solution, I need you to share some details about your current brand identity and what characteristics you would like to emphasize through typography.


Please answer the following questions:



What is the name of your brand and what industry does it operate in?

Please describe your current brand identity in a few words (for example, modern, playful, sophisticated, traditional, etc.).

What are your brand's core values and mission?

Are there any specific colors, shapes, or imagery associated with your brand?

Which characteristics would you like your new typography to convey (for example, modernity, playfulness, sophistication, etc.)?

Are there any existing materials or platforms where the new typography will be applied (website, print materials, social media, etc.)?

Are there any typefaces you currently use or any that you dislike and would like to avoid?


Once I have this information, I will be able to analyze your current brand identity and suggest typography options that align with your desired characteristics, helping your brand visually communicate its core values and personality more effectively.


I look forward to your response!
